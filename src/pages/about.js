    <h1>About Me</h1>
    <p>Hello there.
    <br/>
    My name is Will Mann, I am a student studying A-Levels at Wellington College. I'm studying a range of STEM subjects at Wellington, which I will be taking in June 2019:
    <br/>
    I am wanting to study to become a computer scientist - I can do, you pay! I have always been interested in computer science, and I always try to continuously learn and try with new technologies or new libraries. Most of my projects contain a different library or different technology - now one could say that I'm not being very efficient, my response to that is this world is always changing, so one method of the time may become outdated before something new starts. This proves that with each project, with each file, with each line of code I will be learning something new about the technological world. There can be many different ways to solve a problem, especially one involving an IT solution, so being a computer scientist requires more than just the ability to write code. Adaptable, inquisitive and innovative; that's what a modern computer scientist needs to be. And that's what I believe I can provide.
